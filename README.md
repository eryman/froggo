### Running FROGGO

Clone the following git respository - https://github.com/eryman/froggo.git - or download the game as a zip file from [here](https://github.com/eryman/froggo/archive/master.zip).

### Playing FROGGO 

Press the left and right keys to select a character.  Once that character is selected, press Enter to start the game!

Use the directional keys to move your character from block to block across the screen.  Move your character to the water while avoiding enemy lady bugs.

Colliding with an enemy causes player to lose a life and restart from origin point.

Reaching the water causes player to gain a point and restart from origin point.

Different colored gems will appear on screen throughout the game.  Collect these to earn an extra point.

Losing three lives will result in a game over.  Press spacebar to return to the character select screen and play again.# froggo
